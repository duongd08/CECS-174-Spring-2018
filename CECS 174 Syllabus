Course Description Introduction to basic concepts of computer science and fundamental techniques for solving problems using the Python programming language. Variables, data types, conditional statements, loops and arrays. Programming style. Applications to numerical and non-numerical problems. Pre-requisites: CECS 100 and MATH 113 (or equivalent)

Course Materials Textbooks: We will use an online textbook from Zybooks, customized to fit the content of this course. To purchase the book: Â· Go to the CSULB bookstore, in person or online at http://csulb.verbacompare.com/comparison?id=378319 Â· After purchasing the book, sign in or create an account at learn.zybooks.com 
Â· Subscribe using the code from the bookstore Online activities from the textbook will account for a portion of your overall grade, so you will need your own copy of the book. Supplementary material outside of the class textbook will be presented and included in tests, learning activities and programming projects.

Communication We will use two different means of communication for this course: 
Â· BeachBoard: I will post all announcements, lectures, assignments, and grades on BeachBoard. If you have not done so already, you should log in to BeachBoard at shttp://beachboard.csulb.edu, then click your name in the upper right corner and select Notifications. Make sure you are receiving Email notifications for News - new item available; this will send you an email any time I make an announcement to the class. 

Â· Piazza: we will use Piazza (https://piazza.com/csulb/spring2018/cecs174/) for class questions and discussions. Once you register, you can use Piazza to post questions regarding lectures, labs, exams, or any other course topic. Your instructors and fellow classmates can
then respond to your question, providing an answer for everyone else to reference in the future. This is much more efficient than emailing your professor, as it allows any of the teaching assistants (or even your helpful peers) to answer your query, cutting down how long you need to wait for a response.

Grading

Components: 
Â· Reading - 5 
Â· Labs - 15 
Â· Homework - 20 
Â· Midterm - 30 
Â· Final - 30

Class grades will be determined using the traditional scale: 
Â· A: Grade >= 90% 
Â· B: 80% <= Grade < 90% 
Â· C: 70% <= Grade < 80% 
Â· D: 60% <= Grade < 70% 
Â· F: Grade < 60%

Activities: Each week I will give a reading assignment from the course Zybook. 
Â· Before the assigned due date listed on Zybooks. typically half an hour before lecture begins. you must complete the selected readings, and correctly answer the Participation Activities and Challenge Activites contained within. 
Â· Participation Activities tend to be easier than Challenge Activities. Both are designed to help reinforce lecture and reading material, and you will get out of them whatever effort you put in. 
Â· Readings will cover material not yet presented in lecture, and lectures will be written with the assumption that you have finished the reading assignments. The best way to fall behind in the class is to skip the reading assignments.
Labs are short programming assignments to be completed during the class' allotted lab time. 
Â· The class will be split into 3 separate lab sections. I will lead one, and student assistants will lead the other two. 
Â· All labs will have an assigned due date, typically at the end of the lab period in which they are assigned. 
Â· You will complete lab assignments with a partner in a process called pair programming, which we will discuss in class.
Â· When complete, you will demo your work to your lab leader, and then turn in your approved work to Drop Box on BeachBoard.
Homework are longer assignments designed to require a more significant investment of time than labs. You will be assigned approximately 5 during the semester. 
Â· Homework assignments will include a programming portion, and some may also include problem solving, writing, or other disciplines. 
Â· Unlike labs, you will complete homework assignments on your own, without a partner. 
Â· Homework assignments will be turned in as a printed hard-copy of your work, and graded for correctness and completeness.

Midterm and final exam are closed-notes and closed-book.

Late penalties: labs and homework will be assessed a 10% late penalty for any fraction of a day that they are late, up to three weekdays after the deadline. Exceptions to this policy can be made in case of illness or personal matters as long as they are substantiated and notication is given at least one day prior to the deadline.
Guidelines For Success in This Class Once you have allocated the necessary time for this course, the following suggestions, courtesy of Undergraduate Adviser Dr. Alvaro Monge, should help you plan your time: Â· Prepare for class by completing the assigned readings before the start of the class meeting. Â· Be on time. Class sessions will start promptly. Â· Write code on your own. As with other STEM classes, reading a book is not sucient to understanding the concepts and thus be successful. You must solve problems on your own. Consider the exercises and problems in the textbook and and solve them. Or if you read an example and you wonder "what if..." try it out! Â· Start assignments early so you have time to ask questions.  Face to face questions are better than email.  If you spend more than 15 minutes and are "stuck" on something, ask for help!  If you email me asking for help the night before something is due you should not be upset if I do not answer.  Make use of the oce hours early! Don't wait until late in the term to seek help. Â· Make sure that your code runs in the lab. This is especially important for those who complete portions of their work at home. Verify that code that runs on another machine actually runs in the lab so there are no surprises at grading time. Â· Seek tutoring if needed. There are at least two centers that provide free tutoring in CECS 174. The College of Engineering Tutoring Center oers free tutoring for many engineering courses including CECS 174. Tutors are available Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters between the hours of 9:00am-6:00pm in EN2-300. The center's website has the detailed schedule. In addition, the HSI STEM program provides tutoring services in many STEM courses, including CECS 174; these services are also free.


Â· Finally, remember, programming takes practice. You may not get it the first time, but keep trying, ask for help, and do your best. Eventually, you might find out that you are pretty good at this whole process!
Recommended Student Load The CSULB Student Load Regulations state the following:
Students are expected to spend, on the average, two hours of preparation and study for each hour of class time. Thus, a three-unit lecture or discussion course normally demands a commitment of nine hours per week averaged over the semester, with the class meeting for three hours a week. This may be considered sucient time to enable a student to do satisfactory work. Students who desire to achieve "A" or "B" grades may wish to spend proportionately more time in their studies.
Assistance With Food and Housing Any student who is facing academic or personal challenges due to difficulty in affording groceries/food and/or lacking a safe and stable living environment is urged to contact the CSULB Student Emergency Intervention & Wellness Program. The website outlining the resources available is www.csulb.edu/basicneeds. Students can also e-mail supportingstudents@csulb.edu or call 562/985.2038. If comfortable, students may reach out to the professor as they may be able to identify additional resources.

Accessibility 
DISABLED STUDENT SERVICES is a student support program within the Student Services Division. Our mission is to assist students with disabilities as they secure their university degrees at California State University, Long Beach. We provide services to over 13,000 students each semester. Over 3,000 students with disabilities have graduated from C S U Long Beach with support from our program. The Disabled Student Services office is located on the 2nd floor in Brotman Hall, room 270. It is your responsibility to notify the instructor in advance of any need for special accommodation due to a university verified disability.
Attendance and Drops Attendance is not required, but all material presented during lecture or lab is fair game for exam questions. I will not redo a lecture for people who missed it the first time. If you miss a class day, it is your responsibility to obtain notes from someone who attended. I do not give pop quizzes. Absences will not excuse you from turning in lab or project assignments on time. You are given plenty of time to complete these assignments, so pace yourself and plan to finish them early in case an emergency causes you to miss a day of class. I will honor drop requests where permitted by university policy.


Academic Honesty 
Some assignments (Homework) in this class are designated as individual work only. 

You may discuss ideas with others, but you may not share code, algorithms, or solutions with any individual on any of these assignments. 

Some assignments (Labs) are pair work only. You are not to share code, algorithms, or solutions to the assignment with any individual except for your partner for the assignment. 

You are not in high school, where cheating is "against the rules" but not actually punished. If I catch you sharing code, discussing solutions, exchanging test cases, or in any way collaborating about one of the assignments, I will reduce your final grade by one full letter grade and report your cheating to the administration. This goes for all parties involved. This is for your own good. You will not make it in this discipline if you cannot write difficult code on your own.

At random points in the semester you may be asked by me to explain parts of an assignment you have turned in. 
If you are unable to answer simple questions about your code to my satisfaction, you will be given a 0 grade for the assignment, and I will investigate whether you have been violating the restrictions above. 

All instances of plagiarism or cheating, no matter how slight, will result in at least a 0 grade for the relevant assignment, and your final letter grade in the course will be reduced by one full grade; the incident will be reported to administration.

P.S.: It has been a year since I took Neal Terrell. At this rate and on, Rosswell has officially retired from being a lab leader!

Again, Neal Terrell will guide and push you just like Robert Mena
